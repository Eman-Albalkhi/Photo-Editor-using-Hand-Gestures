# Photo-Editor-using-Hand-Gestures
The project is a desktop application that utilizes hand gestures to manipulate images, aiming to minimize reliance on traditional input devices such as the mouse and keyboard. The program allows users to open, edit, and save images using image processing techniques while considering different lighting conditions. The user can input a live stream video in real time through the computer's camera, and the application will recognize hand gestures and postures as needed
______
Several features have been implemented in the application, including the ability to input video through the computer's camera, recognize hand gestures and postures through the video, draw a set of points representing the recognized posture or gesture, track hand movement, and apply the recognized hand gestures or postures to perform image editing functions such as Translate, rotation, scaling, skewing, warping, drawing using a brush tool, erasing using an eraser tool, changing the color of the brush, and saving the image.
